# Timer App

A frontend-only countdown timer with presets tailored for workshops and tablet displays. Built to be deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Features
- Preset durations: 30 seconds, 1, 2, 3, and 5 minutes.
- Large, high-contrast countdown readout optimized for tablets.
- Touch-friendly controls that simplify to a single Stop button while running.
- Multi-tone alarm on completion using the Web Audio API.
- Ready for static hosting; currently deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Usage
Open [`index.html`](index.html) in any modern browser. The GitHub Pages deployment is available at <https://tamaroh.github.io/timerapp/>.

## Deployment
The site is served directly from the `main` branch root via GitHub Pages. Pushes to `main` trigger the automatic redeploy. To redeploy manually:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push
```

## Local Development
No build tooling requiredâ€”open the HTML file directly. For changes, ensure audio still triggers (browsers need a user interaction) and test on tablet dimensions.
